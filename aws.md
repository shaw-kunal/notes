# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services‚Äîlike servers, storage, databases, networking, software‚Äîover the internet ("the cloud").

Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers, you can:
- Rent resources on demand
- Pay only for what you use
- Scale up/down easily

There are 3 main types:
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) ‚Äì e.g., AWS EC2
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) ‚Äì e.g., Heroku
- SaaS (Software as a Service) ‚Äì e.g., Gmail, Dropbox

## Advantages of Cloud

1. Cost-Efficient ‚Äì No need to buy and maintain expensive hardware. Pay-as-you-go model.
2. Scalability ‚Äì Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
3. Flexibility & Accessibility ‚Äì Access data and apps from anywhere via the internet.
4. Disaster Recovery ‚Äì Built-in backup and recovery options reduce data loss risks.
5. Automatic Updates ‚Äì Providers handle software and security updates. 
6. High Performance ‚Äì Global network of servers ensures fast performance and low latency.

## Types of Cloud

1. Private Cloud: Exclusively by one buisness or Organization.
2. Public Cloud: The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are ownder and operated by a third party cloud service Provider and delivered over the internet.
3. Hybrid Cloud: Often call 'the best of both worlds' hybird cloud combine on-premises infrastructure clouds so organisationn can reap the advantage of both.

## Service of Cloud

![Alt text](./assests/services-of-cloud.png)

## Global Infrastructure Layers

### Regions:
Geographic areas (e.g., Mumbai, Sydney). Each region comprises multiple, physically separated Availability Zones (AZs).

### Availability Zones (AZs): 
Essentially data centers within a region, designed to be isolated from failures in other AZs.

### Edge Locations / CDN: 
Servers positioned globally to accelerate content delivery using services like Amazon CloudFront.

## AWS OUTPOST
AWS Outposts lets you run AWS infrastructure and services on-premises (in your own data center or office), while still being fully managed by AWS.

## what is aws EC2?
EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud, a key IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) from AWS.

Offers scalable virtual servers (‚Äúinstances‚Äù) that you can launch on-demand in the cloud.

initially, we use hypervisor to run multiple operting system . This is called virtualization.

-Scalability & Elasticity: Easily scale up or down based on workload.

-Pay-as-you-go: Only pay for compute time used.

-Variety of instance types: Options optimized for CPU, memory, storage, or GPU workloads.

3.  **Custom AMIs** ‚Äì Created by you for consistent deployment.



# üåê Private IP vs Public IP on AWS EC2 (Day 17)

## üîπ Private IP
- Used for internal communication within the VPC.
- Static (doesn‚Äôt change while instance runs).
- Not accessible from the internet.

## üîπ Public IP
- Assigned automatically at launch (if enabled).
- Used for internet access.
- Changes if the instance is stopped/started.

we can access the instance with  private ip  via public Ip instance. that means access the public IP instance then access the Private IP instance.

# üåê Types of AWS EC2 Instances(part -18)

![Alt text](./assests/Ec2instance-tyype.png)

## what is Nitro instance-
Normal instance access hardware access using hypervisor but nitro instance directly hardware bypassing the hypervisor. 


# üåê Networking Setting- 19

Q> what is AWS multi AZ(avaibility zone) in aws?

Multi-AZ (Multi Availability Zone) is a high-availability architecture in AWS where your resources (like EC2, RDS, etc.) are replicated across multiple Availability Zones within a region.


# üåê What is EC2 Security group? Day 20/100 :  part-1

An EC2 Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.


- **Attached to EC2 instances**.56+
- Works at the **instance level**, not at the subnet level.
- Define rules based on:
  - **Protocol** (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)
  - **Port range** (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP)
  - **Source/Destination**:
    - IP address
    - CIDR block (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0)
    - Another security group

# why security group is statefulAn EC2 Security Group is called stateful because:

If you allow inbound traffic, the response traffic is automatically allowed‚Äîwithout needing an explicit outbound rule, and vice versa.



#  aws User Data Script: day 24
It‚Äôs a shell script (or cloud-init directive) you attach to an EC2 instance at launch time to automate setup tasks like installing software, updating packages, or configuring the server.


Your instance will automatically run this script once, on first boot.




# Aws Instance Termination Protection
A feature that prevents accidental termination (deletion) of your EC2 instance.


# Aws ec2 Placement Group:26
A placement group in AWS is a logical grouping of EC2 instances within a single Availability Zone that enables low-latency, high network throughput interactions between instances.
- **Cluster Placement Group**: This type groups instances in a low-latency network, which is ideal for applications that require high performance and low latency, such as high-performance computing (HPC) applications.
 However, cluster placement groups cannot span multiple Availability Zones, and if the Availability Zone fails, all instances in the group fail.
- **Partition Placement Group**: This type distributes instances across different partitions within an Availability Zone. Each partition represents a rack in AWS, and instances in one partition do not share the same hardware with instances in another partition. This provides high availability and is suitable for large distributed and replicated workloads.

- **Spread Placement Group**: This type places instances on distinct hardware across different Availability Zones, which reduces the risk of simultaneous failures. It is suitable for applications that require maximum high availability.

# Aws Tenancy: day 27
Determine how the physical hardware on which your instances run is shared with other AWS accounts.

1. Shared(Default)
2. Dedicated Instance (no shared beteen physical host )
3. Dedicated Host(full control)



# AWS Pricing Plan: day 28;

![Alt text](./assests/Pricing_plan.png)


# elastic IP :Day 32

We know every time when we restart the instance then new IP address assign. But If we want to use the same ip,then we can purchase the elastic IP.



# what is instance Store? day:34

In AWS, Instance Store is temporary block-level storage physically attached to the host machine. Here's a quick breakdown:
Also called ephemeral storage.
Provides high-speed, low-latency storage.
Data is lost when the instance stops, terminates, or fails.

## what is Elastic Block Storage (EBS)?

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) is persistent block-level storage for EC2 instances.

Data persists even after instance stops or terminates.
Can attach/detach volums across instance.
Data stored in multiple AZs
![alt text](assests/Instance-store-ebs.png)
## Difference between EC2 instance store and EBS store
![alt text](assests/Instance_ebs_diff.png)

# AWS EBS Volume Types: GP2, GP3, and Provisioned IOPS

- Use **gp3** over gp2 for most general-purpose needs.
- Use **io1/io2** for databases and applications with high IOPS/throughput/durability needs.



# AWS Snapshot: Day 40

## What is a Snapshot?

A **snapshot** in AWS is a point-in-time backup of an Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume.

## Key Features

- **Backup**: Stores a backup of your EBS volume.
- **Incremental**: Only changes made after the last snapshot are saved.
- **Stored in S3**: Though not directly accessible through the S3 interface.
- **Restoration**: Can be used to create new EBS volumes or restore old ones.
- **Use in AMIs**: Can be used to create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

## Use Cases

- **Data Migration**: Move data between regions or accounts.
- **Version Control**: Maintain different states of data over time.

## How to Create a Snapshot

### Using AWS Console:
1. Go to EC2 Dashboard.
2. Click on "Volumes" under Elastic Block Store.
3. Select a volume.
4. Click on **Actions > Create Snapshot**.
5. Provide a name and description, then create.

### Using AWS CLI:
```bash
aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0 --description "My snapshot"
```

# Day - 41 : Practical of AWS snapshot and their uses

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ORzlAqTIU&list=PLIm9KY-ideOsCuwMRoX1ltMZGuNZeBrRp&index=41)

# DAY - 42: AWS Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)

## üöÄ What is Fast Snapshot Restore?

**Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)** is an AWS feature that enables **low-latency, fully-initialized EBS volumes** from snapshots. Without FSR, volumes created from snapshots may experience **initial I/O latency** as data is loaded lazily from Amazon S3.

## üß† Why Use FSR?

- Avoid performance hit during initial read operations.
- Ideal for **production workloads**, **disaster recovery**, and **automated scaling**.
- Speeds up instance launch time from snapshots (especially for large EBS volumes).

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- Supported on **EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2, gp3)** and **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1, io2)**.
- Enabled **per Availability Zone**, **per snapshot**.
- Charges **per AZ per hour** while FSR is enabled.

## üí∏ Pricing

You are charged **per snapshot per Availability Zone per hour** where FSR is enabled.  
Refer to official pricing: [AWS EBS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Enabling FSR (CLI Example)

```bash
aws ec2 enable-fast-snapshot-restores \
  --source-snapshot-ids snap-1234567890abcdef0 \
  --availability-zones us-east-1a
  ```

# Day 43: EBS Lifecycle Manager (DLM) ‚Äì Automated Snapshots and Backup

## üîπ What is EBS Lifecycle Manager (DLM)?

[EBS Lifecycle Manager](w) is an AWS feature that **automates the creation, retention, and deletion of Amazon EBS snapshots**. It helps enforce backup policies without manual intervention.

---

## üîπ Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Automated Backups**: Schedule snapshot creation based on policies.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Retention Rules**: Automatically delete old snapshots after a specified time.
- üîí **Cross-account Copy**: Share and copy snapshots to another AWS account.
- üìÖ **Daily, Weekly, Hourly** schedule support.
- üîÅ **Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)** integration.

---

## üîπ How It Works

1. **Create a Lifecycle Policy**
   - Define target resources (via **tags**).
   - Set schedule frequency (e.g., daily at 5 AM).
   - Configure retention (e.g., keep 7 days of backups).
2. **DLM runs automatically** based on your rules.
3. **Snapshots are created and deleted** without manual effort.

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) ‚Äì Notes DAY:57

## üîπ What is VPC?
- A logically isolated section of AWS cloud.
- You define the IP address range, subnets, route tables, gateways, etc.
- Acts like your own **private data center** on AWS.

---

## üîπ Key Components

### ‚úÖ CIDR Block
- IP range for your VPC (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`)
- Max: `/16` (65,536 IPs), Min: `/28` (16 IPs)

### ‚úÖ Subnets
- Divide your VPC into **public** and **private** subnets.
- **Public Subnet**: Has route to Internet Gateway.
- **Private Subnet**: No direct internet access.

### ‚úÖ Route Tables
- Control traffic routing within VPC.
- Public subnets have a route to Internet Gateway (IGW).
- Private subnets use NAT Gateway/Instance for internet-bound traffic.

### ‚úÖ Internet Gateway (IGW)
- Enables internet access for instances in **public** subnet.

### ‚úÖ NAT Gateway / NAT Instance
- Allows instances in **private** subnet to access the internet (outbound only).
- NAT Gateway is managed, scalable & preferred.

### ‚úÖ Security Group
- Virtual firewall for EC2 instances.
- **Stateful**: Return traffic is automatically allowed.

### ‚úÖ Network ACL (NACL)
- Firewall at **subnet level**.
- **Stateless**: You must allow both inbound and outbound rules.

### ‚úÖ VPC Peering
- Connect two VPCs privately.
- Must update route tables to allow communication.

### ‚úÖ VPC Endpoints
- **Interface Endpoint**: Connect to AWS services via private IP.
- **Gateway Endpoint**: For S3 & DynamoDB.

---

## üîπ VPC Design Best Practices
- Use multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
- Separate public/private workloads into respective subnets.
- Use NACLs for broad access control; SGs for instance-level control.
- Enable **Flow Logs** for monitoring VPC traffic.

---

## üîπ Use Cases
- Host secure web applications.
- Deploy multi-tier architectures (web + app + DB).
- Create hybrid cloud via VPN or AWS Direct Connect.

## 5 step to create VPC:
![alt text](./assests/5stepprocess.png)
1. Give VPC name
2. Add assign private IP
3. Add subnet
4. 



![alt text](./assests/vpc-subnet.png)
* Important-
We can create any number of subet with in AZ.
if We have 3 AZ in a region, then we need to create atleast 3 subnet for each AZ.

CIDR block issue:  we can not assign same CIDR block in other VPC.

solution -1 : Edit VPC and add a new IP4 CIDR and use it.
limitation: But we can add atmost 5 CIDR block.

solution - 2 : 

We need to  generate the subnet for for Private IP block.
Eg:- we need to two different ip block then.
we have a CIDR block: 192.168.0.0/24

we need two subnet then 

192.168.0.0/25
192.168.0.128/25


# Day-61: How to create AWS Public Subnet , Private Subnet?

public Subnet: A subnet that has a route to the internet gateway , allowinng resources inside it to send receive traffic from te internet directly.


Private Subnet: A subnet that does not have a route to te internet GateWay. Resources in it can only access the internet through a NAT Gte or Basiton host and are not Directlyyy accessible from thhe internet.

# Day -62: AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)- Internet Gateway (IGW) | What is an Internet Gateway?


## What is an Internet Gateway?
An **Internet Gateway (IGW)** is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available **VPC component** that allows communication between **instances in your VPC and the internet**.

It performs two critical functions:
- **Provides a target** in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic.
- **Performs network address translation (NAT)** for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses.

---

## Key Features

- Fully managed and scalable by AWS.
- Enables inbound and outbound access to/from the internet.
- One IGW per VPC.
- Does not cause availability risks or bandwidth constraints.

Day 63: How to access the private ec2 instance with public instance?

Dat-64: What is VPC NAT GATEWAY?
A **NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway** enables **instances in a private subnet** to **connect to the internet** or other AWS services, but **prevents the internet from initiating connections** with those instances.

# Day 65:  VPC Peering in AWS

VPC peering is a networkinng connection between two virtual private clouds that enable traffic to route privately using IPV4 or IPV6 addresses without using:

- Internet Gateway 
- NAT Gateway
- VPN
- AWS Direct Connect

Day-66 : Summary of VPC from part-1 to part-7


1> **Definition**: A Virtual Private Cloud is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account within the AWS cloud. It Provide a logically isoltated environment for your aws resource.

**Configruation**:  
-VPC are created with specified range of IP address using CIDR  block notation.
- AWS support IPC4 CIDR bolc between /16 and /28 netmask.
- You can add up to 5 CIDR range within single VPC .

**Maximux VPCs per range:** Default limit is 5 region . but his can be increase upon request.




2> **Subnet** : A subnet is segmentation portion of VPC's IP address range. allowing for organized allocation of IP address.
-**Configruation** : Subnet's are created within AZs.
- **Subnet per VPC** - Default limit 200

3. Public Subnet : Subnet that's accessible from the internet.
Usage: Typicallyt for web server and load balancer.
Point to considr: requries an intenet gateway for internet access.


4. Private Subnet: Subnet not accessible from the **internet**. Ideal for sensitive server like database.
- point to remembert: Require a NAT  gateway for outbound internet access.


5. **Internet Gatway**:  it is used to connect AWS VPC to the internet.
Configuration: Attached to VPC and routes traffic to from the internet.

- Point to consider: Public IP is necessary for resources in the public subnet to communication with the internet.


6. NAT gateway: enables instance in a private subnet to access the internet for update and download.

Configuration : Place in public subnet with an elastic IP address.

 -Point to consider: No inbound traffic allowed to private subnet through NAT.
- Each NAT  GATEWAY supports up to 55000 simultaneorus connection.
- Bandwidth up to 45 GBPS, depending on the instance type.


7. Route tables: COntrol where network traffic is directed.
Configraution : 
- main route table - automatically  create, managed default routing for all subnet.
 - custom Routes tables _ created manaullt for specific routing needs.
 Point for to consider: Define rules to determin network traffic direction.


 Route tables per VPC : default limit is 200.

 Routes per Route table- 50
