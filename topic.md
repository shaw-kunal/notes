###############################################################
Import and export syntax.

Basics of JSX and how it gets transpiled into JavaScript.
Conditional rendering.
Event Handling in React:

Handling form inputs, button clicks, etc.
Synthetic events vs native events.
Component Lifecycle:

Lifecycle methods in class components.
How hooks like useEffect replicate lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount).
React Router:

Basics of routing in React using react-router-dom.
Programmatic navigation and nested routes.
State Management:

Lifting state up in React.
Context API for managing global state.
Basics of Redux (if relevant to your experience).

General Tips:
Be prepared to explain the "why" behind your decisions, not just the "how." Interviewers often want to understand how you approach problem-solving.
Work on small side projects or contribute to open-source projects to strengthen your hands-on experience.
Practice writing clean, maintainable code, and be ready to explain your design choices during code reviews or whiteboard sessions.
By focusing on these topics, you'll have a strong foundation for the interview and demonstrate your capability to handle real-world problems.
