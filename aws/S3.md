# DAY-145 :  Simple Storage Service 

It is Scalable object storage service 

**What is Object storage ?**
Object Storage is a method of storing data as distinct objects, each with its own identifier and metadata, in a flat environment for scalable and easy access.


**Object Storage VS  Block storage**

*Advantage of Object storage* 
 - Object storage save data as object , Each object is stored sperate and independently.
 - Every object includes the data itself , a unique ID to find it easily , and metadata which is addition about the data.
 - Each object can access directly via its unique Id, allowing for quick retrival of data from anywhere.
 - It's greate for storing large amounts of unstructed datra like photos , vidoes and documents , especially when you need to access them over the internet.

 *Disadvantage Object Storage*
 - Object Storage often has higher latency than block or file storage

 - for storing small files , it can be ineffeicient bcz of their meta data.

 - not optimized for data modifications.
 - some older application may not directly compatiable.


 *Object Storage Use Case*
 - Perfect for keeping big files like photos , videos and large documents which don't fit well in traditional database.
 - Ideal for backup and storing old data because it can handle lot of infortion with costing costing too much
 - Greate for sharing files worldwide easily , like CDN
 because you can access files from anywhere

# DAY - 148: Storage Class- part 2 S3 express one zone

**S3 Express One Zone:**- Amazon s3 express one zone is a high performance , single zone amazon s3 storage class that is purpose built to deliver consistent, single-digit millisecond data access for your most latency-sensitive applications.

- S3 Express one zone is the lowest latency cloud object storage class available today, with data access speeds up to 10x faster and with request costs 50 percent lower than S3 standards.

_Directory buckets_- It use the s3 express one zone storage class, which is built to be used by performance sensitive applications. With s3 express one zone , you can select a single availibility zone with the options to co-locate your object storage with your compute resources, which proviced the highest possible access speed.

eg: let we have 3 AZ's

- AP-south-1A
- AP-south- 1B
- AP-south-1c

if our application running on AP-south-1A and direcory bucket in AP-south-1c then somehow latency will be increase.so better to keep both instance in same availibility zone.

# üóìÔ∏è Day 150 || AWS S3 || S3 Versioning

**üìò What is S3 Versioning?**
S3 Versioning is a feature that keeps **multiple versions** of an object in the same bucket.
It helps you **recover** from accidental deletion or overwrites.

‚öôÔ∏è **Key Points:**

- When versioning is **enabled**, every new upload of the same object creates a **new version** with a unique **Version ID**.
- If versioning is **suspended**, existing versions remain, but new uploads overwrite the old version (no new version ID).
- You can **retrieve, restore, or permanently delete** specific versions.
- **Delete marker** is added when an object is deleted (does not immediately remove data).
- Works well with **Lifecycle Policies** to automatically clean up old versions.

Note - if versioning is disable then we can not restore deleted file.
but if versioning is enable then

- it create a new version of file with _deletedMarker_
- we can restore that old version file any time

# üóìÔ∏è Day 151 || AWS S3 || S3 Lifecycle Rule Part 1

_Lifecycle rule s_ - it offer a way to automate data management and optimize storage cost based on access needs.

- Create mutliple rules within a single lifecycle configuration for your bucket.

**Lifecycle rules filter type**

- Prefix
- Object tags
- Object size

# üóìÔ∏è Day 152 || AWS S3 || S3 Lifecycle Rule Part 2

Exercise: what we have to do?

| Time since upload | Storage Class             | Action        | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0 days            | S3 Standard               | OBject upload | intially upload in standard storage class |
| 30 days           | S3 IA                     | Transition    | move to infrequent access storage class   |
| 90 days           | S3 One Zone IA            | Transition    | move to one zone for further cost svaing  |
| 365 days(1 year)  | Glacier flexible retrival | Transition    | move to glacier storage class             |
| 3 years           | Glacier deep archive      | Transition    | move to deep archive for long term        |
| 10 years          | -                         | Expiration    | delete the object after 10 years          |

Note -Deleted the object is also depend on versioning

if versioning is disable then it will delete permanently.

if versioning is enabled then after 10 year it will create new version with deleted marker. So make sure enable permanent of delete in new version

# üóìÔ∏è Day 153 || AWS S3 || Controlling Access to AWS S3 buckets

The proces of managing who can view, change or delete the object stored within your AWS s2 bucket

_Controlling Access Tools_

- IAM policies
- Bucket policies
- ACLs

How it work

> user -> IAM Policy -> Bucket Policy -> ACL -> Bucket

Note -
if all three( IAM policy, bucket policy, ACL) is not attached then access will be deny
if atleast one allow rule and rest policies are not attachehed then access will be granted.
if atleast one deny rule then no matter about other it will always denial of access.

# üóìÔ∏è Day 154 || AWS S3 || AWS IAM Policy Vs Bucket Policy

**Difference between IAM Policy and Bucket policy**

| Feature       | IAM Policy                   | Bucket Policy                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Managment     | Manage via the IAM dashboard | Bucket level                  |
| Format        | Json                         | Json                          |
| Scope         | Identity-based               | Resource based                |
| Use case      | Broad AWS permission         | Specific s3 permission        |
| Attached to   | IAM user, group , roles      | S3 buckets                    |
| Best for      | multiple AWS services        | specific S3 access            |
| Cross-account | Complex configuration        | Ideal for s3 cross-account    |

    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",

                "arn:aws:s3:::read-only-bucket-kk/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

- _Write-Only Access policy_

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",

        }
    ]
}
```

- _Full Access policy_

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",

            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

# Day 156 || AWS S3 || AWS Bucket Policy For S3

**_S3 bucket policy for read Access policy_**

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::155677035996:user/s3-user"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [

                "arn:aws:s3:::read-only-bucket-kk/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Note -but for console access , we need to give permission to list out all the bucket via which user will be access

so make sure in case of console access, attach a policy to user to list out all bucket

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

# Day 157 || AWS S3 || AWS S3 Bucket Access Control List

_Introduction_ : ACLs (access control lists) are a legacy mechanism for managing permission on S3 bucket and objects.

- They provide basic way to grant access (read , write) to specific accounts or predefined groups.
- They can control access at both the bucket level (for listing the contents of buckets) and the object level (for accessing individual files)

_Default status_ : Disable

# Day 158 || AWS S3 || AWS S3 Object Lock

_AWS S3 Object Lock_ - It allow you to prevent the deletion of an object or the modification of its version for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. This can help you protect your data from accidental or malicious deletions and modifications.

**Terminalogy**-

_Retention mode_ -: Rules that determine how stricly an s3 object version is protected from modification or deletion fo a set period of time.

- Governance mode : Users with special permissions can alter or remove the retention settings or delete the object version.
  permission : s3.BypassGovernanceRetention, s3:putObjectRetention

- Compliance mode : No one can alter or remove the retention settings or delete the object version, not even the root user in your AWS account.
  _Default status_ : Disable

_Retention Period_ : it refers to standard duration for which object will be locked

_Legal Hold_ : In addition to retention period, you can also apply a legal hold on an object

- A legal hold provides the same protection as a retention period but does not have predenfined expiration date
- This can be useful in scenario such as legal investigation when you do not know when the need to retain the data will end.

**Enable Object Lock**-
Access Permission: Ensure that you have necessary permission to manage object lock setting.

- Before you turn on Object lock , bucket versioning must be enabled.
- By default, object lock is disbaled.

- This can be achieve through IAM permission or by bucket policy. Permission include
  - s3:PutObjectLegalHold
  - s3:PutObjectRetention
  - s3:GetObjectRetention

**Default Retention**-
_Disabled_: Your want complete control over which object have object Lock. You have varying object lifespan needs within a bukcet. Flexibility to modify or remove protection easily is a priority.
_Enabled_: You want o consistent layer of protection for obejct in bucket. Compliance regulation mandate data immuntability. You wish to stramline object protection and reduce manual configuration.

# Day 159 || AWS S3 || AWS S3 Encryption Part 1
_Amazon S3 Encryption_ - It is a security feature that helps protect your data at rest by converting it into a format that is unreadable to unauthorized users. Encryption can help you safeguard sensitive information and comply with regulatory requirements.
